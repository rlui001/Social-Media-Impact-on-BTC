# Social Media Impact on BTC
A data engineering capstone project that explores the potential impact social media has on Bitcoin.

# Current Limitations:
+ Twitter API allows monthly 500,000 tweet usage. Either I will need to upgrade my developer access, or make use of other historical data sets (like Kaggle) that covers 2016-2019. This means the raw data being extracted may differ in quality and expectations, as my extracts may have different criteria. Another option is to restrict the tweets that I pull from only accounts that meet a set criteria.
